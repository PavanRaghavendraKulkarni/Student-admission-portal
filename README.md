# Student-admission-portal

Every year, students in thousands queue up for collecting admission / application  
Forms and then again for submitting the admission / application forms. This leads to  
Problems in managing the applications, resulting in annoyed parents and students alike.  
Institute incurs expenditure on printing of admission forms, and in absence of any reliable  
Forecasting system on how much application it is going to receive it may overspend by  
Printing excessive application forms or may fall in crisis if there is excess demand of application forms. Chances of form misplacement are very high, because of huge number of  
Applications. Wastage of institute's resources due to involvement of people / teachers in  
Form collection.  
 
The goal of Online Admission System is to computerize the admission management  
System structure, its related operation, and functionality to rectify these weaknesses. Also,  
The purpose is to provide support to the administration and admission seeking candidates  
By providing a faster, transparent, and easy way of maintaining records and utilize them for  
Reference and further proceedings.
